You can change what your program does by adding decision-making to it. Programmers make a program react to different situations using JavaScript conditional statements. The most important part of a conditional statement is the condition itself. It's a test that checks to see if something is either true or false. JavaScript provides "comparison operators" to help with conditional statements.

Boolean Values
Every condition evaluates to either true or false. True and false have a specific meaning in JavaScript, they're called "Booleans," and along with strings and numbers, they represent a third type of value (or data type) in JavaScript.
