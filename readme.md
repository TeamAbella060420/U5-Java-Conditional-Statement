You can change what your program does by adding decision-making to it. Programmers make a program react to different situations using JavaScript conditional statements. The most important part of a conditional statement is the condition itself. It's a test that checks to see if something is either true or false. JavaScript provides "comparison operators" to help with conditional statements.
